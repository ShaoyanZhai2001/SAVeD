## 🛣️ 3. Variable: `ROAD_SURFACE_CONDITION` — Road Surface Condition

### 📘 Definition  
This variable describes the surface condition of the roadway at the time of the event, which directly impacts vehicle control, traction, and braking efficiency.

---

### 📌 Annotation Notes

- When wet spots or melting snow are visible but not dominant, annotate based on the **overall driving condition**.
- If a road transitions during the video (e.g., snow melts), label based on **when the event occurs**, not general driving condition.


---

## ⚖️ 4. Variable: `GUILTY` — Fault Attribution

### 📘 Definition  
This variable indicates which party is considered at fault for the incident based on video evidence and contextual cues. It helps evaluate AV decision-making in safety-critical scenarios.

---

### 🧩 Label Options

| Value              | Description                                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `AV`               | The autonomous vehicle was primarily at fault             |
| `non-AV`           | The other road user was primarily at fault                |
| `both`             | Both parties contributed to the incident                  |

---

### 🎬 Video Examples (Click to View)

#### 1. `AV` — AV is at fault
[![AV Guilty](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6jSMxcnTklo/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6jSMxcnTklo?t=123)  
⚠️ *AV failed to yield and collided with cross traffic. Video clearly shows AV's improper judgment.*

---

#### 2. `non-AV` — Other party is at fault
[![Non-AV Guilty](https://img.youtube.com/vi/PKHfruXYmVY/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/PKHfruXYmVY?t=825)

---

#### 3. `both` — Shared fault
[![Shared Fault](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IjFsu5mirkw/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/IjFsu5mirkw?t=179)  
⚖️ *Both the AV and the other driver made poor decisions leading to the crash. Mutual misjudgment observed.*

---

### 📌 Annotation Notes

- Annotate fault based on **behavioral evidence in the video**, not just outcomes.
- If the AV makes a legal maneuver but fails to detect/respond adequately, it may still be labeled at fault.
- In complex situations, label as `both` when mutual errors clearly contribute to the incident.

---

### 📌 Annotation Notes

- Focus on the **first point of contact** between vehicles, not secondary impacts.
- For multi-vehicle crashes, annotate the **main AV-to-object contact**.
- “Sideswipe” does not imply high damage but indicates motion alignment and partial contact.

---

## 🚗 Variable: `TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_VEHICLES` — Total Number of Vehicles Involved

### 📘 Definition  
This variable counts the total number of vehicles directly involved in the crash event. It helps characterize the scale and complexity of the incident.

- A "vehicle involved" refers to any road user that physically contacted or directly contributed to the collision sequence.

---

### 🧮 Example

#### Multi-Vehicle Crash — 3 Vehicles Involved  
[![Three Vehicles](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ecGSJVRCvC4/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ecGSJVRCvC4?t=17)  
🚗🚗🚗 *This crash involves three vehicles in a chain-reaction rear-end collision. All three vehicles sustained some level of damage.*

---

### 📌 Annotation Notes

- Do **not** count vehicles that simply witnessed the crash or stopped nearby.
- For sideswipe crashes involving several glancing contacts, count **all physically contacted** vehicles.
- In rare edge cases with trailers or towed equipment, count each **motor vehicle unit** separately。

---

## 🧱 Variable: `CRASH_WITH` — Object of Collision

### 📘 Definition  
This variable identifies what the autonomous vehicle (AV) collided with during the incident. It distinguishes among road users, static obstacles, and infrastructure elements.

---

### 📌 Annotation Notes

- In multi-object crashes, label based on **initial point of contact**.
- If the AV swerves and hits infrastructure while avoiding another object, use **the actual collision target**.
- “Infrastructure” includes curbs, cones, signs, fences, and poles.
