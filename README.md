> ## üîç 1. Example: Variable `LIGHT_CONDITION`

This variable describes the lighting condition of the scene during the crash or near-miss. It is classified into:

### üìå Annotation Notes

- If multiple weather phenomena are present (e.g., rain + fog), annotate with the **most dominant** condition that affects visibility or driving.
- `fog/smog/smoke` may also include wildfire smoke or industrial smog that significantly impairs AV sensors or human view.
